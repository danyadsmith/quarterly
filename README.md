At its root, the word "magazine" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles.<sup>1</sup> The first magazines were published in the 17th century. Since its inception, the magazine has evolved to become a significant artifact of popular culture and an accessible platform for sharing and distributing content relevant to a targeted audience. The internet and the proliferation of connected devices continues to transform the publishing industry, but the written word and its popular forms—books, newspapers, and magazines—persist. 

Quarterly is an open-source framework for creating an online magazine. It includes the following features:

* **Subscription Management:** Site visitors can initiate trial subscriptions and annual subscriptions. Content can be configured as publicly-viewable, previewable, and subscription-only.
* **Back Issues:** Site visitors can purchase access to back issues on an individual, annual, or _complete my collection_ basis.
* **Submission Management:** Contributors can submit content for publication for a nominal fee. Premium Constributors can submit content without paying a fee. The Editor-in-Chief and Guest Editors (per issue) can review and recommend submissions for publication. The Editor-in-Chief promotes submissions to articles.
* **Author Profiles:** Featured authors receive an author profile page. Author profiles include a brief bio, a link to the author's website, contact information (e-mail, social media links), and the ability to announce upcoming events and services. An author is considered _featured_ when they publish a feature article. Article types can be configured
* **Issue Publication and Organization:** Accepted submissions are promoted to articles and are assigned to a particular issue for publication. Articles belong to sections and have column types. Issues are published by the Editor-in-Chief.
